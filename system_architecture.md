  - **Response Analyzer**: Analyzes responses to detect vulnerabilities

### 4. Technical Implementation Components

- **Headless Browser Engine**: Based on Puppeteer/Playwright for dynamic testing
- **Proxy Interceptor**: For request/response analysis
- **HTTP Request Crafter**: For custom HTTP request creation
- **JavaScript Analyzer**: For client-side vulnerability detection
- **API Endpoint Discovery**: For API testing
- **Intelligent Crawler**: For comprehensive site mapping
- **Authentication Handler**: For testing secured areas
- **Session Manager**: For session analysis
- **Scan Policy Manager**: For custom scan policy creation
- **Throttling Controller**: To prevent target overload

### 5. Reporting System

- **Report Generator**: Creates detailed technical reports
- **Severity Classifier**: Uses CVSS for vulnerability classification
- **Reproduction Guide**: Generates steps to reproduce findings
- **PoC Generator**: Creates proof-of-concept demonstrations
- **Remediation Advisor**: Provides fix recommendations
- **Export Engine**: Supports multiple export formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, JSON)
- **Verification System**: For validating fixes
- **Historical Tracker**: For tracking vulnerability history

### 6. Testing Environment

- **Sandbox Controller**: Manages isolated testing environments
- **Network Isolator**: Creates isolated network environments
- **Vulnerable App Manager**: Deploys intentionally vulnerable applications
- **Technology Stack Simulator**: Simulates different technology stacks
- **Version Control Integration**: For test case management

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Containerized services using Docker
- Local development setup with Docker Compose

### Testing Environment
- Isolated testing environment with mock services
- Integration testing environment

### Production Environment
- Hybrid deployment model:
  - On-premises deployment option
  - Cloud-based deployment option (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Kubernetes orchestration for scalability
- Load balancing for high availability

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**:
   - User configures scan through the UI
   - Authentication service validates user permissions

2. **Scan Execution**:
   - Scan Management Service initiates the scan
   - Vulnerability Detection Engine performs the scan
   - Real-time updates sent to the frontend

3. **Result Processing**:
   - Vulnerability findings collected and analyzed
   - Severity classification applied
   - Reporting Service generates comprehensive reports

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Users can verify findings
   - Historical tracking updates vulnerability status
   - Remediation recommendations provided

## Security Considerations

- **Platform Security**:
  - Secure authentication with multi-factor options
  - Role-based access control
  - API security with rate limiting and token validation
  - Secure storage of sensitive data
  - Audit logging for all actions

- **Operational Security**:
  - Scan throttling to prevent DoS on target systems
  - Secure handling of discovered vulnerabilities
  - Isolation of testing environments
  - Secure storage of scan results and evidence

## Integration Capabilities

- **CI/CD Integration**:
  - Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI integration
  - Automated security testing in development pipelines

- **External Tool Integration**:
  - JIRA/Trello for issue tracking
  - Slack/Teams for notifications
  - Other security tools for comprehensive testing

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling of microservices
- Database sharding for large datasets
- Caching strategies for improved performance
- Asynchronous processing for resource-intensive operations

## Monitoring and Maintenance
