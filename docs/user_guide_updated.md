For demo purposes, you can use any email and password combination to log in.

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of your security testing activities:

- **Statistics Cards**: View the total number of scans, active scans, and vulnerabilities at a glance.
- **Recent Scans**: See your most recent security scans with their status and findings.
- **Vulnerability Summary**: View a breakdown of vulnerabilities by severity level.

From the dashboard, you can:
- Start a new scan by clicking the "Start New Scan" button
- View all scan results by clicking "View All"
- Generate reports by clicking "Generate Report"

## Starting a New Scan

1. Navigate to the "New Scan" page from the dashboard or the sidebar menu.
2. Follow the three-step wizard:
   - **Step 1**: Enter the target URL and scan name, and select the scan type (Quick, Full, or Custom).
   - **Step 2**: Configure vulnerability checks and scan performance settings.
   - **Step 3**: Review your configuration and start the scan.

### Scan Types

- **Quick Scan**: Performs basic checks for common vulnerabilities. Faster but less comprehensive.
- **Full Scan**: Performs all available security checks. More thorough but takes longer.
- **Custom Scan**: Allows you to select specific vulnerability checks to perform.

## Viewing Scan Results

1. Navigate to the "Scan Results" page from the sidebar menu.
2. View a list of all your scans with their status, date, and number of findings.
3. Click on any scan to view detailed results.

### Vulnerability Details

When viewing a specific scan, you can:
- See a list of all identified vulnerabilities
- Filter vulnerabilities by severity
- View detailed information about each vulnerability, including:
  - Description
  - Location
  - Severity
  - CVSS score
  - Evidence
  - Remediation recommendations

## Managing Projects

Projects help you organize your security testing activities:

1. Navigate to the "Projects" page from the sidebar menu.
2. Create a new project by clicking "New Project" and entering the required information.
3. Add scans to your project to keep related security testing activities together.

## User Management

Administrators can manage users through the "User Management" page:

1. View all users
2. Add new users
3. Edit user roles and permissions
4. Deactivate or delete users

## Generating Reports

1. Navigate to the "Reports" page or click "Generate Report" from the dashboard.
2. Select the scan for which you want to generate a report.
3. Choose the report format (PDF, HTML, or CSV).
4. Click "Generate" to create the report.
5. Download the report once it's ready.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Scanning**: Schedule regular security scans to identify new vulnerabilities.
- **Verify Findings**: Always verify identified vulnerabilities to eliminate false positives.
- **Prioritize Remediation**: Address critical and high-severity vulnerabilities first.
- **Document Changes**: Keep track of remediation efforts and rescan to verify fixes.
- **Use Projects**: Organize your scans into projects for better management.

## Troubleshooting

- **Scan Fails to Start**: Verify that the target URL is accessible and correctly formatted.
- **High False Positive Rate**: Adjust scan sensitivity or use custom scan policies.
- **Performance Issues**: Reduce scan throttling to minimize impact on target systems.
- **Login Required**: Use authentication handling for scanning protected areas.
